TODO:
FIX SQL INJECT VULNERABILITY! (prepared statements)
add better mod tools in order to fix any problems that may come up
give mods a listing of all the commands they have in help, and give them better commands to reverse games and the like
have openpack tell you if/how many packs you have left to open
have help for individual commands
completely rework the way that command handling works to reduce code duplication and improve permissions / input parsing
redo the league data file to use only prepared statements
create a way to view listings of players, games, .etc
generate packs in bulk, then assign packs to players when they go to open them (much more efficient means of generating packs)
show how long is left in the week in the status menu
add status menu versus help menu (help menu does commands, status handles league status)
have help be more informative

check JSON reprint rarity change


create ways in discord to config bot
rewrite bot to be more configurable
make bot compatible with multiple guilds
make better tools for handling bad match reporting, .etc


Feature Ideas:


League Ideas:
-Chaos League: every card is replaced with a card ever printed at that rarity
   -might have to leave off older sets due to changes in rarity (modern+?)
-Special packs: players have a chance of opening a pack that is special e.g. journey to nyx god packs
-Seeded packs: packs will be seeded towards a particular archetype/color combo, mechanic, .etc
-Picking Seeded packs: players are given a small slate of 3 or so packs, and are told only how they are seeded, players are then able to open one of the packs that slate. Slate resets every time a new pack is opened.
-Ravnica mashup: all Ravnica sets are able to found in packs from day 1. Probably would have to be combined with picking seeded packs in one fashion or another (e.g. guilds for 3 weeks, mechanics for 3 weeks, .etc)\
   -Innistrad
   -Mirrodin
   -Zendicar
   -Dominaria (unlikely)
   -Theros
-Cube league: packs are "flat" (no rarity assignment) and picked off a cube list
   -monocolor
   -weird & wacky
   -peasant
-Shitty Standard league: only shitty deviant standard decks
-you may have X copies of this card in your deck League
-brawl
