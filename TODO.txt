check JSON reprint rarity change and other stuff

create ways in discord to config leagues
make bot compatible with multiple guilds / multiple leagues








League Ideas:
-Chaos League: every card is replaced with a card ever printed at that rarity
   -might have to leave off older sets due to changes in rarity (modern+?)
-Special packs: players have a chance of opening a pack that is special e.g. journey to nyx god packs
-Seeded packs: packs will be seeded towards a particular archetype/color combo, mechanic, .etc
-Picking Seeded packs: players are given a small slate of 3 or so packs, and are told only how they are seeded, players are then able to open one of the packs that slate. Slate resets every time a new pack is opened.
-Ravnica mashup: all Ravnica sets are able to found in packs from day 1. Probably would have to be combined with picking seeded packs in one fashion or another (e.g. guilds for 3 weeks, mechanics for 3 weeks, .etc)\
   -Innistrad
   -Mirrodin
   -Zendicar
   -Dominaria (unlikely)
   -Theros
-Cube league: packs are "flat" (no rarity assignment) and picked off a cube list
   -monocolor
   -weird & wacky
   -peasant
-Shitty Standard league: only shitty deviant standard decks
-you may have X copies of this card in your deck League
-brawl
-custom cards
