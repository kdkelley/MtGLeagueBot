rewrite bot to allow more configurable leagues
   -allow configuration via discord commands

fix split and other cards in the db
   -need to make some handy tools for massaging data as future leagues seem like they're gonna need it

make bot compatible with multiple guilds / multiple leagues

have the bot make a weekly summary post
have an option for the bot to assign a weekly "target" to each player (so as to make a large loop of all players)
   -need to make a way to remove players from league for mods
   -also need to add moderator options to change targets then

move setmod to an owner-only command

set the names of the cogs to something more user-friendly

add some sort of donation scheme / moneybegging
   -offset / pay for hosting costs
   -additional funds go towards developing additional features / new leagues'
   -charity drive during each league: 
      -players use donations to vote for the next league format to be chosen
      -players can suggest ideas for leagues, which will not be able to be voted on until the *next* league

multiplayer game compatibility / allow for multiplayer game reporting


League Ideas:
-"Traditional" league:
   -Masters (done once in VTSFFC)
      -3 weeks Iconic Masters
      -3 weeks Masters 25
      -3 weeks Ultimate Masters
   -Tarkir (done once in VTSFFC) (3/2/4)
   -Urza's (3/2/4)
   -Time Spiral (4/2/2)
      -maybe also with the planechase deck?
         -either during each individual game, or have passive plane effects rolled for every game on a weekly or daily basis
   -Innistrad (3/2/4)
   -pretty much any block TBH
-Chaos League: every card is replaced with a card ever printed at that rarity
   -might have to leave off older sets due to changes in rarity (modern+?)
-Special packs: players have a chance of opening a pack that is special e.g. journey to nyx god packs
-Seeded packs: packs will be seeded towards a particular archetype/color combo, mechanic, .etc
-Picking Seeded packs: players are given a small slate of 3 or so packs, and are told only how they are seeded, players are then able to open one of the packs that slate. Slate resets every time a new pack is opened.
-Ravnica mashup: all Ravnica sets are able to found in packs from day 1. Probably would have to be combined with picking seeded packs in one fashion or another (e.g. guilds for 3 weeks, mechanics for 3 weeks, .etc)\
   -Innistrad
   -Mirrodin
   -Zendicar
   -Dominaria (unlikely)
   -Theros
-Cube league: packs are "flat" (doesn't care about rarity, just 15 unique cards) and picked off a cube list
   -monocolor
   -weird & wacky
   -peasant
   -silver border?
-Shitty Standard league: only shitty deviant standard decks
-you may have X copies of this card in your deck League
-brawl/EDH
-"money" league
   -packs are ~75% EV (so people don't just buy their decks)
   -players start with 3 packs
   -every week players get some amount of money (more than enough to buy a pack), added to their accounts
   -players can buy singles for their real world value
   -players cannot sell cards
   -possible other ways of getting money:
      -just playing games
      -winning games
      -losing games
      -playing with weekly target
-custom cards
