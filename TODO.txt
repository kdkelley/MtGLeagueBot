# TODO:
# FIX SQL INJECT VULNERABILITY! (prepared statements)
# add better mod tools in order to fix any problems that may come up
# give mods a listing of all the commands they have in help, and give them better commands to reverse games and the like
# have openpack tell you if/how many packs you have left to open
# have help for individual commands
# completely rework the way that command handling works to reduce code duplication and improve permissions / input parsing
# redo the league data file to use only prepared statements
# create a way to view listings of players, games, .etc
# generate packs in bulk, then assign packs to players when they go to open them (much more efficient means of generating packs)
# show how long is left in the week in the status menu
# add status menu versus help menu (help menu does commands, status handles league status)
# have help be more informative

# check JSON reprint rarity change
